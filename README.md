# Emotion cause pair extraction as a question answering problem

CS685 NLP Project in Spring 2023 at Umass 

We have three tasks to complete in our project proposal: 

## Task 1: Replication of this work: https://github.com/NUSTM/ECPE-MLL
- `task1/ECPE-MLL-Pytorch`: contains our replication of the above work, originally using Tensorflow 1.x and Python 2. 
  - The below are commands to run the code:
  ```bash
  cd task1/ECPE-MLL-Pytorch
  # the hyperparameters are stored in the config.py file
  python train.py 
  ```

## Task 2: Evaluting the ECPE task using GPT3.5 
- `task2/`: 

## Task 3:ECPE as an extractive question-answering problem 
- `task3/`: contain code for our experiments
